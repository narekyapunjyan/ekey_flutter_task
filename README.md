# ekey_flutter_task

This project is a Flutter application designed to manage a product inventory with web support using Chrome.

Why Simple Architecture?
This project uses a simple architecture due to its focused scope:

Flutter Bloc Pattern: State management is handled using the flutter_bloc package, providing a clear and predictable way to manage application state.

Stateful Widgets: For components requiring local state management, stateful widgets are used to keep logic encapsulated and modular.

The decision to use a simple architecture was made to optimize development speed and maintainability. Given the straightforward requirements of managing an inventory, a more complex architecture was deemed unnecessary.
